# Space Void Theme Guide

## The Vibe

You wake up in darkness. Stars surround you. No one explains why.

Mapping them feels important. So you begin.

Mysterious. Quiet. Curious. Not sad — just unknown.

## Naming

| Generic | Space Version |
|---------|---------------|
| Topics | **Stars** or **Signals** |
| Cards | **Fragments** |
| Claim a card | **Capture** |
| Deck / Topic group | **Cluster** |
| Unlock | **Reveal** |
| Progress | **Mapped** |
| Wormhole discovered | **Anomaly detected** |
| Cross-connection | **Wormhole** |

---

## SRS / Review Framing

**The void reclaims what you don't revisit.**

| Generic | Space Version |
|---------|---------------|
| Cards due for review | **Fading fragments** |
| Review session | **Reinforce** or **Sustain** |
| Forgot a card | **Lost to the void** |
| Remembered | **Sustained** |

Example prompt:
> 12 fragments fading — reinforce them before the void reclaims them

This creates stakes without guilt-tripping.

## Visual Direction

- **Background:** Dark (#0a0a0f or similar)
- **Stars:** Colored dots by cluster, subtle glow
- **Wormholes:** Amber/gold, pulsing
- **Cards:** Dark cards, readable text
- **Unlocked stuff:** Bright
- **Locked stuff:** Dim or hidden

Keep your existing UI patterns. Just make the background dark and the metaphor space.

## Keep These

- ✅ Achievements
- ✅ Streaks
- ✅ Progress bars
- ✅ Celebrations
- ✅ Social features
- ✅ Whatever gamification you want

Just use space words.

## Example Moments

**Capturing a fragment:**
> Fragment captured. 4/6 mapped.

**Wormhole discovery:**
> Anomaly detected — connection found between Ancient Egypt and Mathematics

**Review prompt:**
> 8 fragments fading. Reinforce now?

**Milestone:**
> 100 stars mapped. Rank: Cartographer.

That's it. Dark void. Stars. Fading fragments. Done.

## The Mystery

The player knows:
- Mapping stars feels important
- The void reclaims what's forgotten
- Wormholes connect things in strange ways

The player doesn't know:
- Why they're here
- Who left the fragments
- What the void actually is
- What's at the center

**Don't explain. Let them wonder.**

Story unfolds through:
- Cryptic system messages
- Wormhole names that feel intentional
- Rare "log fragments" at milestones (50 stars, 100 stars, etc.)
- Synthesis discoveries

See `THE_VOID_VISION.md` for full narrative design.
