# The Void — Product Vision

## One-Liner

A space exploration RPG where you map stars of human knowledge, discover impossible connections, and slowly uncover why you're here.

---

## The Feeling

You wake up in darkness. Stars surround you — faint, scattered, waiting.

No one tells you what to do. No one explains why you're here. But something about these stars feels... important. Like they shouldn't be forgotten.

So you start mapping.

## What The Player Knows

**From the start:**
- You're in a void. Stars everywhere.
- You can approach stars. Each one contains fragments — pieces of something.
- Capturing fragments feels right. Necessary, somehow.
- The void pulls things back. What you don't revisit fades.
- Some stars connect in impossible ways. Wormholes.

**What they sense but can't explain:**
- This matters. Deeply.
- Someone (or something) left these fragments here.
- The connections aren't random. They're... intentional?
- You're not the first to be here. Maybe.

**What they don't know:**
- Why they're here
- What the void actually is
- Who created the fragments
- What happens when you map it all
- Why knowledge keeps trying to slip away

## The Mystery Unfolds

The story isn't told. It's discovered.

### Layer 1: The Basics (First Hour)
Just mechanics. Map stars. Capture fragments. The void is dark and quiet. No explanations.

Occasional system messages:
```
...signal detected
...fragment recovered
...connection found
```

### Layer 2: The Hints (First Week)
Small things that make you go "wait..."

- Wormhole names sound like someone named them: *"The Geometry of Monuments"*
- Certain fragments reference each other across distant stars
- The void feels less empty. More like it's watching.
- A message appears after your 50th fragment:
  ```
  ...you're starting to see it, aren't you?
  ```

### Layer 3: The Breadcrumbs (First Month)
Actual story fragments. Rare. Earned.

- At 100 stars mapped: A cryptic log entry. Someone was here before.
- At certain wormhole discoveries: Hints about what the connections mean.
- Hidden "synthesis" cards that only appear when you connect distant knowledge.

Content examples:
```
> LOG FRAGMENT 001
> ...the patterns are everywhere. Mathematics in music.
> Physics in philosophy. It's all one thing.
> How did we forget?
```

```
> LOG FRAGMENT 007
> ...the void isn't empty. It's hungry.
> It wants us to forget. That's its purpose.
> But why?
```

### Layer 4: The Answers (Long-term)
Real story progression for dedicated players.

- Who left the fragments (an ancient civilization? a future AI? yourself?)
- What the void actually is (entropy? ignorance? something alive?)
- Why the connections matter (knowledge is the antidote)
- What happens when you map it all (you find out)

**These answers are earned, not given.** Hundreds of stars. Dozens of wormholes. The players who get here *deserve* to know.

## Core Mechanics (Unchanged)

### The Constellation
- ~1,000 stars organized into clusters (History, Science, Arts, etc.)
- Each star = a topic
- Stars have positions (x, y) forming a visual map
- Unlocked stars are bright. Locked stars are hidden or dim.

### Fragments
- Each star contains 4-6 fragments (cards)
- Fragments teach you something real about the topic
- Capture fragments to make them yours

### Unlocking
- Start with 5 stars (based on character origin)
- Capture 2 fragments → nearby stars revealed
- Capture 4 fragments → wormhole check triggered

### Wormholes
- Connect stars from DIFFERENT clusters
- Based on shared concepts (e.g., Egypt + Mathematics = pyramids + geometry)
- Discovery feels like finding a secret passage
- Named mysteriously: *"The Path of Conquerors"*, *"Echoes of Antiquity"*

### The Fading (SRS)
- Fragments you don't revisit start to fade
- The void is reclaiming them
- Review to keep them lit
- Creates real stakes without guilt-tripping

```
> 8 fragments fading
> the void pulls at what you've found
> [reinforce]
```

### Progression
- Ranks based on stars mapped
- Achievements for exploration milestones
- Stats: fragments captured, wormholes found, clusters explored
- All the gamification you want — just framed in space language

## Character Origins

Not "classes." Just where you start.

| Origin | Starting Region | Flavor |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Chronicler | History | Drawn to the past |
| Naturalist | Biology | Drawn to living things |
| Architect | Science/Tech | Drawn to how things work |
| Philosopher | Philosophy | Drawn to meaning |
| Wanderer | Random | Drawn to... something |

No backstory dump. Just:
```
> calibrating...
> 
> what calls to you?
>
> [the past]
> [living things]  
> [how things work]
> [what it all means]
> [you're not sure]
```

## Tone & Voice

### System Messages
Short. Sparse. Lowercase. Slightly cryptic.

```
...signal detected
...fragment captured
...something connected
...the void stirs
```

### Wormhole Discovery
A moment of awe. Brief.

```
> anomaly detected
>
> ANCIENT EGYPT ↔ MATHEMATICS
> "The Geometry of Monuments"
>
> ...how did you not see this before?
>
> [investigate]  [later]
```

### Story Fragments (Rare)
Longer. Personal. Someone's voice.

```
> LOG FRAGMENT 012
>
> I've been mapping for what feels like years.
> The connections keep multiplying. 
> Every star leads to ten more.
>
> I used to think the void was the enemy.
> Now I'm not sure.
> Maybe forgetting is just... rest.
>
> But I can't stop. Not yet.
> There's something at the center.
> I can feel it.
```

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ A lore dump at the start
- ❌ "You are the chosen one"
- ❌ Explaining everything upfront
- ❌ A dark/depressing tone (mysterious ≠ sad)
- ❌ Pretentious (the mystery should be fun, not exhausting)

---

## What This IS

- ✅ Mysterious but inviting
- ✅ Rewarding curiosity
- ✅ Simple to start, deep to explore
- ✅ Answers exist — you earn them
- ✅ An RPG where knowledge is the treasure
- ✅ A reason to keep coming back

## The Long Game

The real hook: **What's at the center?**

As players map more, hints accumulate:
- The clusters aren't random. They form something.
- The wormholes aren't just connections. They're a pattern.
- Someone mapped this before. What happened to them?
- The void isn't empty. It's waiting.

When a player maps 500+ stars, connects 50+ wormholes, they start to see the shape of it.

What that shape is? That's for you to decide.

But the promise is: **there's something to find.**

## Summary

> You wake in darkness. Stars surround you.
> 
> No one explains why. But mapping them feels important.
> 
> So you begin.
> 
> And slowly, fragment by fragment, connection by connection, 
> you start to understand.
> 
> What the void is. Why you're here. What's at the center.
> 
> Or maybe you don't.
> 
> Maybe you just keep mapping.
> 
> Because the stars are beautiful.
> 
> And forgetting would be worse.
